          <h4>The Problem</h4>
          <p>HealthCare.gov needed a way for shoppers to view plans without being caught in the bottleneck of creating an account.</p>
          <h4>The Solution</h4>
          <p>Ad Hoc was engaged by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to fully redesign, develop and operate the <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/see-plans/">Premium Estimation Tool</a> and <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/taxes/tools/silver/">Tax Tools</a>  for open enrollment 2015 (November 2014 - March 2015). With a small agile development team and less than 5 months of development time, Ad Hoc delivered a responsive, mobile-first solution that served over 400 million unique visits, the highest traffic portion of HealthCare.gov, with no downtime over the course of open enrollment for 2015.</p>

          <blockquote>
            &ldquo;Working with Ad Hoc was the best decision we made for open enrollment 2015.
